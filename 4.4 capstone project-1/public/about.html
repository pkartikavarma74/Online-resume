<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Hello! I am a 4th-year BTech student specializing in Computer Science and Cybersecurity at CMR Engineering College. 
  I created this portfolio to share more about myself and to practice my HTML skills as I embark on my web development journey.
   While I am still honing my expertise, I have a strong foundation in problem-solving, team spirit, and basic coding skills in C++ and Java. 
   During my first year, I ranked third in my class, demonstrating my dedication and commitment to my studies.</p>

<p></p>
Outside of academics, I am passionate about keeping up with the latest technology trends, which I do by following select Telegram channels and reading news articles. 
In my free time, I enjoy playing games and listening to music. 
I strive to bring enthusiasm and professionalism to everything I do.
 I am eager to join a dynamic team where I can contribute, grow, and help drive innovation.
